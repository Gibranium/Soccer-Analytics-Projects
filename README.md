This is my personal Github, in here you can find the Jupyter Notebooks I've used to create my visualizations and projects featured in The Cutback, my [newsletter](https://the-cutback.beehiiv.com/). 

Here are some of the examples, feel free to explore the github and the newsletter, replicate the things you like and maybe give me some feedback or improvements idea.
